Twitter app Which reads the stream of tweets and classify them as positive and
negative(May be in the future this can be extended to various other imotions).
The application also visualizes the result at each geographical coordinates on
a map using basemap module. It dynamically reads the tweets, classify it and
plots it on the map.

This is just a basic prototype. There are lots of issues in it that is to be
fixed. Suggestions and any kind of contributions welcome.
